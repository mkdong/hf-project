Happy Festival Project

This is a small project to fast generate an executable to celebrate some festivals.

## Syntax and Usage
The syntax is extremely simple:

```
#!/bin/hf
h FestivalName f
```
You can replace the FestivalName with any festival as you like.

Save the source code in a file `xxx.hf`,
and then you can pass the file to `hf.py` program as follows:
